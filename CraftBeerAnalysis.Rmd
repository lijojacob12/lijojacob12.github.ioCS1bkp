## How many breweries are present in each state

This code first cleans up the breweries data set removing duplicated data. For example breweries with difference in upper and lower case letters.

We then join the breweries data set to a US map data set so we can visualize our finding. Based on the data that we provided the States with the most breweries are Colorado (47), California (39), Michigan (32), Oregon (29) and Texas (28).A list of all 50 States and the number of breweries prints out at the end of this code block

## IBV & ABV

In this section we join the breweries data to the beer data. 

There was duplicated data in the beer data set for example beers with year in the name as well as beers with different oz which was not relevant to our analysis.

We noticed that there was quite a bit of missing data in both the ABV and IBU columns. After running the commented out R code we discovered that the data was not missing completely at random with certain breweries missing all ABV and IBU columns.Based on this we manually got the data from external sources (untappd.com). We still couldn't find all of the missing data so for the remaining 23 beers with missing ABV data we dropped them from the data set. We then imputed the mean of IBU by style for the remaining missing IBU data.

```{r Replacing missing values}
# Read in the data that has been manually updated (replaced all missing ABU 
# values that could be found)
beerGit <- getURL(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lijojacob12/DDSCaseStudy1/main/raw_data/beers_data_updated.csv")
beersnewdf <- read.csv(text = beerGit, header=TRUE)
newbbjoinddf <- merge(beersnewdf, breweriesdf, by.x = "Brewery_id", 
                      by.y = "Brew_ID")
colnames(newbbjoinddf)[which(names(newbbjoinddf) == "Name.x")] <- "Beer_Name"
colnames(newbbjoinddf)[which(names(newbbjoinddf) == "Name.y")] <- "Brewery_Name"

# Print first and last 6 observations in this data set
head(newbbjoinddf)
tail(newbbjoinddf)

# Remove Dates from beer names ex: Undertaker and Undertaker (2014)
newbbjoinddf$Beer_Name <- str_remove_all(newbbjoinddf$Beer_Name, '[(\\d{4})]')

# Remove Duplicates based on beer name, brewery and style this will get rid of 
# the before mentioned beer with dates as well as beers with just different oz

  distinct(Beer_Name, Brewery_id, Style, .keep_all=TRUE)

## Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.

The median IBU is 33 and the median ABV is 0.056 for this data set. One thing to note is for the median ABV data set by State Utah has a regulation where you can not sell beers with more than 5% ABV which is why the median is so low.

The reason why West Virginia has an extremely high IBU is because West Virginia only has two beers in this data set which is messing with the results.

```{r median alcohol}
# create data frames for median for ABV and IBU by State 
mergedDfIBU = mergedDf %>% group_by(State) %>% summarize(Median_IBU=median(IBU))
mergedDfABV = mergedDf %>% group_by(State) %>% summarize(Median_ABV=median(ABV))
# Get overall median for ABV and IBU

## Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?

Colorado does not have a maximum ABV limit for beer sold in stores or served in restaurants and bars Colorado's high altitude can affect the brewing process, leading to a higher ABV in some beers. Colorado has a long history of craft brewing which allows experimentation and innovation. 

Lee Hill Series Vol. 5 - Belgian Style Quadrupel Ale by Upslope Brewing Company in Boulder, Colorado has maximum ABV(12.8%)


Bitter Bitch Imperial IPA by Astoria Brewing Company in Astoria, Oregon is the most bitter beer with 138 IBU.

Bitter Bitch Imperial IPA
The high bitterness is achieved through the use of a blend of six different hops.

```{r Highest ABV and IBU}
# State with highest ABV
max_abv <- mergedDf %>% group_by(State) %>% summarize(Max=max(ABV)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Max))
head(max_abv,1)

# Beer with highest ABV
mergedDf %>% filter(ABV==0.128)
max_ibu <- mergedDf %>% group_by(State) %>% summarize(Max=max(IBU)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Max))

# State with highest IBU
head(max_ibu,1)
# Beer with highest IBU
mergedDf %>% filter(IBU==138)
```


## Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.

The mean (5.97%) is greater than the median (5.6%) so this data is slightly right skewed. 

When you break out summary statistics by beer type (IPA, Other Ales, Other beers) IPAs are normally distributed but Other Ales and Other beers are still right skewed.

``` {r Summary Statistics and Distribution of ABV}
# Summary statistics for data set
summary(mergedDf$ABV)
# Box plot of data to provide more context of summary statistics
mergedDf %>% ggplot(aes(x=ABV)) + geom_boxplot()
# Adding new column called "Typ" that classifies IPAs, Other Ales, and Other
# beers
AllBeersDF = mergedDf %>% filter(!is.na(ABV)) %>%
  mutate(Typ= case_when(
    stringr::str_detect(toupper(Style), "\\bIPA\\b")~"IPA",
    stringr::str_detect(toupper(Style), "\\bALE\\b")~"Other Ales",
    TRUE~"Other Beers"))

# Count the number of each "Typ" of beer
AllBeersDF %>% group_by(Typ) %>% count()

# Distribution for all ABV
AllBeersDF %>% ggplot(aes(x = ABV, fill = Typ)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count",width = .0008) +
  ggtitle("Overall ABV Distribution") + 
  ylab("Count") + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16)) 
# Distribution for each type ABV
AllBeersDF %>% ggplot(aes(x = ABV, fill = Typ)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count",width = .0008) +
  ggtitle("ABV Distribution for Beer Types") +
  ylab("Count")  +
  facet_wrap(~Typ)  + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 8)) 
```

## Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.    Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.

The evidence suggest that there is a positive relationship between IBU and ABV.

Soft cap on ABV at 10% which might be due to state regulations in some of the states.

By looking at the data based on Type of beers, IPAs tend to have more bitterness for same Alcohol content when compared with other Ales and other type of beers.


``` {r Relationship between bitterness and alcoholic content}
# Scatter plot of overall relationship between IBU and ABV 
AllBeersDF %>% ggplot(aes(x=IBU,y=ABV)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter") +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  ggtitle("IBU - ABV Relationship") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16)) 

# Scatter plot of relationship between IBU and ABV by type
AllBeersDF %>% ggplot(aes(x=IBU,y=ABV, color = Typ)) +

  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  ggtitle("IBU - ABV Relationship for Beer Types") +
  facet_wrap(~Typ) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16)) 
```

## Use KNN to investigation the relationship between ABV and IBU 

We first determined the optimal value for K by iteration over random samples of test and train data 200 times for the values of K ranging from 1-20. The optimal value was 5 for this data set.

Using 5 for K in our KNN classifier we were able to achieve ~90% accuracy in classifying beer type in the data. 

Visualizing the classification we can clearly see that there is a dividing line between IPAs and Other Ales around 50 IBUs.


``` {r KNN classifier}
# Create function to iterate over random samples of test and training data to 
# help determine the optimal value for K
knn_loop <- function(iterations, num_of_k_s, split_percent, data_for_model,

## Knock their socks off!  Find one other useful inference from the data that you feel Budweiser may be able to find value in.  You must convince them why it is important and back up your conviction with appropriate statistical evidence.
